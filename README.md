# Welcome to the Big Co. Salary Calculator

## Project Description

As a Big Co. payroll supervisor you will find this payroll invaluable in calculating your monthly payroll costs.
This site allows for the input of your employees by first and last name, employee number, job title and annual salary.
It then will calculate the monthly cost of all listed employees' salaries and provide a warning should that cost exceed your more than generous payroll budget of $20,000.00.

## Installation

Opening the index.HTML file is all you need to do install Big Co. Payroll Calculator.  Actually I think you will need JQuery 3.5.1 install locally as well.  You can get JQuery at https://jquery.com/download/.

## Usage

1. Download all files from https://github.com/Astronatural/jquery-salary-calculator
2. Open index.HTML in whatever browser you prefer, but I hope it's Chrome, because that's the only one I tested it on.
3. Enter your employees data in the input fields under "Add Emplyoee"
    3.1.  Please be specific!  The fields will not filter the information provided by you.
4. Click "Submit" to add the employee to the "List of Big Co. Employees" (they are lucky to be working for us).
5. The site will automatically calculate your monthly payroll expence from the "annual salary" date you provided.
6. Should your payroll expendature exceed your budget ($20,000.00) you will be notified by the "Total Monthly Costs" number turning red.
7. Should you wish each employee in the "List of Big Co. Employees" is equipped with a "Fire Them" button to remove that employee from the "List of Big Co. Employees". (We didn't need them anyway!)
8. Note: firing employees in this manner will not (currently) alter "Total Monthly Cost".  That feature is pending my learning a few more JQuery tricks...
